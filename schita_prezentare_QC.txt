- cartoonish style pictures - already used + from regev's presentation;
- for "related work"I would suggest just mentioning about: QHE of Urmila, UBQC and QFHE of Broadbent, Schaffner, maybe flow ambiguity;
- one single slide to mention about other possible applications of QFactory;
- one slide about the needed assumptions which come from the trapdoor function;
- slides for UBQC and how it can be used UBQC + QFactory;
- 1 slideabout the actual security model and perhaps at the future work slide mention the extentions to malicious and verfiability;
- then the actual construction;
- 1-2 slides about how we actually obtain such a function;
- for the security proof it should be at least 1 soide for the intuition, specifically why the properties of the functions should suffice; then something more formal which includes the definition of hardcore, and the ideea of the goldreich levin proof
