# Slides talk QCrypt 2018: On the possibility of classical client blind quantum computing - Alexandru Cojocaru, *LÃ©o Colisson*, Elham Kashefi, Petros Wallden

I made these slides for my talk at QCrypt 2018. You can find the pdf in `diapo_qcrypt.pdf`, and the LaTeX sources are also available. All the source and the images I made (at least `qubit*.png` and `ghz*.pdf` (should have the sources of the `ghz` somewhere as well)) are licensed under the MIT license, so feel free to use them as you wish.

NB: I was not careful enough (my bad) when I took the other images, so I cannot guarantee the license of them. If any author has a problem with me putting the images here, please contact me or fill an issue.
