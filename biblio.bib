abstract="Cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators known so far suffer from the handicap of being inefficient; the most efficient ones can generate only one bit on each modular multiplication (n                2 steps). Blum, Blum and Shub ask the open problem of outputting even two bits securely. We state a simple condition, the XOR-Condition, and show that any generator satisfying this condition can output logn bits on each multiplication. We also show that the logn least significant bits of RSA, Rabin's Scheme, and the x                2 mod N generator satisfy this condition. As a corollary, we prove that all boolean predicates of these bits are secure. Furthermore, we strengthen the security of the x                2 mod N generator, which being a Trapdoor Generator, has several applications, by proving it as hard as Factoring.",

abstract="McEliece is one of the oldest known public key cryptosystems. Though it was less widely studied than RSA, it is remarkable that all known attacks are still exponential. It is widely believed that code-based cryptosystems like McEliece do not allow practical digital signatures. In the present paper we disprove this belief and show a way to build a practical signature scheme based on coding theory. Its security can be reduced in the random oracle model to the well-known syndrome decoding problem and the distinguishability of permuted binary Goppa codes from a random code. For example we propose a scheme with signatures of 81-bits and a binary security workfactor of 283.",
